# Tic-Tac-Toe with Mathematical Strategy

This project is a Python implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with additional mathematical features. As an advanced mathematics student delving into computer science, I've incorporated logic to demonstrate strategic thinking in game-play.

## Features
- Classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board
- Code structure for easy readability and adaptability
- Demonstrates advanced Python skills for game logic and strategy

## Skills & Concepts Used
- **Python Basics**: Loops, conditionals, functions
- **Math Integration**: Logic-based strategies and evaluations
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Organized game flow for efficient code readability

## Getting Started
To play the game, clone the repository and run `tictactoe.py` in your Python environment. Follow the prompts to make your move!

## Potential Future Improvements
- Adding an AI opponent
- Visual interface with a Python library
